# ChemE-Project-Template

In this repository you can find our Pluto notebook outlining our process for producing hydrazine from d-xylose, and a video explaining this process and highlighting the role each team member played in completing this project. Our actual Pluto Notebook can be found in the project folder in the file "ENGRI-1120-Project-Template.jl".
